Use the pipe
method one
  directly using the pipe after the pipe symbol |
    <small>{{item.size | filesize : 'M'}}</small>

    import {Pipe,PipeTransform} from "@angular/core";
    @Pipe({
      name: 'filesize'
    })
    export class FilesizePipe implements PipeTransform{
      transform(size:number, extension: string = 'MB'){
        console.log(size,extension);
      }
    }

method two
  import pipe from the customized file, and define pipe in component constructor arguments list
  injecting the pipe by providers in component
  use pipe's transform method to ...
